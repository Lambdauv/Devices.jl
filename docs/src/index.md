# Devices.jl

A [Julia](http://julialang.org) package for designing CAD files for superconducting devices.

## Installation

+ Install [gdspy](http://gdspy.readthedocs.org), which is currently used only
for rendering paths into polygons: `pip install gdspy`. Ensure that it is accessible
from the Python installation that PyCall.jl is using.

+ Install [pyqrcode](https://github.com/mnooner256/pyqrcode), which is used for
generating QR codes: `pip install pyqrcode`.

+ `Pkg.clone("https://github.com/ajkeller34/Clipper.jl.git")`
+ `Pkg.clone("https://github.com/ajkeller34/Devices.jl.git")`

## Quick start

```
using Devices, FileIO

p = Path()
style = launch!(p)
straight!(p,500,style)
turn!(p,Ï€/2,150)
straight!(p,500)
launch!(p)
c = Cell("main")
render!(c, p)
save("test.gds", c)
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you cannot save the GDS file, try deleting any file that happens to be
at the target path.
